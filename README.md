## tms

tms(toy media server) is a toy media server for myself learning media develop.

## Feature
- [x] publish media by rtmp
- [x] publish media by webrtc
- [x] publish media by srt
- [x] plya media by rtmp
- [x] play media by http-flv
- [x] play media by http-hls
- [x] play media by webrtc
- [x] play media by srt
- [x] media demux/remux, like rtmp(flv) to webrtc(rtp)
- [ ] transcode
- [ ] MCU
- [ ] media server forward, current tms is only a single server node

## Todo
- sdp generater and sdp parser, instead of hardcode xxx.sdp
- WebRTC adapt to different version of chrome
- WebRTC adapt to different video encoder
- friendly API

## Bugs
There are many bugs in WebRTC, because the complexity.

## Usage

**Step 0**: build-tools 

```sudo apt-get install tcl```

this is for srt install.

**Step 1:** get source code

cd tms
```

**Step 2:** fetch depend
```

## Example

### 1. publish rtmp using obs, play flv/hls/rtmp using vlc

publish rtmp using obs, I use host "hw.com" to hide my server ip for safety.

play http-flv using vlc

play hls using vlc

play rtmp using vlc

### 2. publish using chrome(WebRTC), play using chrome(WebRTC)
chrome publish vp9, I use host "hw.com" to hide my server ip for safety, and it's hardcode in sdp.
